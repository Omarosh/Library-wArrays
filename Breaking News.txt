OMAR UPDATE
___________
News:
-When you are inserting a book, you can type R in the ISBN section to generate a random ISBN instead of typing it yourself
-Now delete book and delete member are working more properly and in coherence with insert book and insert member.
-Fixed some errors in menus, now it works much better.
-Added "0) Terminate" choice to some menus.. (if the user types 0, the program terminates)
-Fixed Return function not working
-added print books,members and borrows in Adminstrative actions menu.

To be:
Still the choice of "5) Save" is not working and it makes the files empty.

I merged my edits and your edits in one file.
